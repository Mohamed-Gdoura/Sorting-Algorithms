Bubble Sort Implementation

This project contains an implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm. Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

ðŸ”§ Features

Sorts a list/array of numbers in ascending order

Simple and easy-to-understand implementation

Suitable for educational purposes

ðŸ§  How Bubble Sort Works

Start at the beginning of the list.

Compare each pair of adjacent items.

Swap them if they are in the wrong order.

Repeat the process for all elements until the list is sorted.

Time Complexity:

Best Case: O(n) (optimized version only)

Average & Worst Case: O(nÂ²)
Space Complexity: O(1)

ðŸ§  Insertion Sort

This project implements the Insertion Sort algorithm â€” a simple and intuitive sorting algorithm suitable for small datasets or nearly sorted data.

ðŸ“Œ What is Insertion Sort?

Insertion Sort builds the final sorted array one element at a time. It works similarly to how we sort playing cards in our hands.

Time Complexity:

Worst Case: O(nÂ²)

Best Case (Already Sorted): O(n)

Average Case: O(nÂ²)

Space Complexity: O(1) (In-place sorting)

Stable: âœ…

ðŸ“Ž How It Works

For each element in the array:

Compare it to the previous elements.

Shift all larger elements to the right.

Insert the current element into the correct position.
