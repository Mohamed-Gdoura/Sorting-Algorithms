Bubble Sort Implementation

This project contains an implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm. Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

ðŸ”§ Features

Sorts a list/array of numbers in ascending order

Simple and easy-to-understand implementation

Suitable for educational purposes

ðŸ§  How Bubble Sort Works

Start at the beginning of the list.

Compare each pair of adjacent items.

Swap them if they are in the wrong order.

Repeat the process for all elements until the list is sorted.

Time Complexity:

Best Case: O(n) (optimized version only)

Average & Worst Case: O(nÂ²)
Space Complexity: O(1)
